## **CI/CD Configuration**

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The configuration file is located in `.github/workflows/unittests.yml`. It runs unit tests with `pytest` on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.

The workflow does the following:
1. Sets up Python.
2. Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Runs tests using `pytest`.

## **Data Analysis**

The data analysis involves the following steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Analyze the distribution of the data, missing values, etc.
   - Generate basic plots and statistics.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyze the sentiment of news headlines.
   - Categorize the sentiment into positive, negative, and neutral.

3. **Technical Indicators**:
   - Use `TA-Lib` to calculate financial indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI).

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Compute correlations between sentiment scores and stock returns.

---

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yetimnew/financial-news-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

---

## **Usage**

After setting up the environment, you can start working on the project in the Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks/` folder.

### **Run the Analysis**
- Open `notebooks/eda.ipynb` to begin the exploratory data analysis.
- Follow the steps within the notebook to load and analyze the data.

### **Run Unit Tests**
- To ensure that everything works, run the unit tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
